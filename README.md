The simple console game: Guess a number

The computer selects a random number in a given range. The player tries to guess the computer number. If the number is guessed before the allowed attempts are finished, the player moves to the next level. There are 3 levels. With each level, the range from which the computer selects the number increases, while the allowed guess attempts decrease. Find the computer number in each level and win the game! :)
